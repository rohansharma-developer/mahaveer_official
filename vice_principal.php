                <p style="text-align: left;" class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The first step into school is that giant step forward, where children embark on the great adventure of discovering the wide world outside and the depth of the world within. As we hold the little finger and guide the young ones forward, we realize our responsibility of nurturing their curiosity, igniting their minds to pierce the skies, helping them to discover the world of books and richness of experience, ponder on the “mystery of birds in the sky, the bees in the sun, the flowers on a green hill”, and today master the magic of technology and the limitless span of cyber space.
                    We, at Mahaveer International School believe that education is a process of awakening individual potential to creative knowledge, but more importantly enlightening students with the wisdom that they must “never put a price tag on their heart and soul”. A good career is important but a good character is paramount. We believe that ‘individuals’ are the atoms that hold tremendous power within to serve as agents of change and thus are confident that our students, enriched with a sense of high morality and social responsibility will be makers of a virtuous society. I firmly believe that every human being endowed with various talents and skills is a precious gift of God. I am very pleased to bring to your notice that Mahaveer International School is one of those schools which provide ample opportunities along with a value based wholesome quality education to nurture the inner potentials of every child.In a world of stiff competition, strife and unrealistic aspirations, it calls for sensitivity on our part as educators to help children understand that predicament is common to everyone. Problems and challenges need to be faced courageously with conviction in our principles and confidence in our inner strength and dreams.</p>
